# A.I-car
 An artificial intelligent car that learns all best route on each trip so as to navigate the road.

## How This Works
The Artificial intelligent car relies on Neural Networks Training/Intelligence.
Neural networks rely on training data to learn and improve their accuracy over time.
However, once these learning algorithms are fine-tuned for accuracy, they are powerful tools in computer science and artificial intelligence, allowing us to classify and cluster data at a high velocity.

## How do neural networks work?
Overall, AI, machine learning, and neural networks are complementary technologies with each providing a foundation for the other. Thus, machine learning ideas often overlap with deep learning ones such as facial recognition and object detection.
